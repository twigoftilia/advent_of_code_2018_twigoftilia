# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

Trying to learn rust, so why not take on some of the Advent of code 2018 challenges :)
Busy busy, so the ambition is moderate. Mostly (only) weekends maybe? You should probably look at other peoples code for best practice idiomatic rust.

Well, at least day one done!

Until further notice,
