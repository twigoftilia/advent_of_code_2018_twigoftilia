# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

Trying to learn rust, so why not take on some of the Advent of code 2018 challenges :)
Busy busy, so the ambition is moderate. Mostly weekends... 
Warning - you should probably look at other peoples code for best practice idiomatic rust.

## Goals

Personal goal and rules (so very different from my "real" coding):
 
  * used rust
  * finish say 10 puzzles
  * no peaking at AoC threads
  * challenge myself to leave code that I know could be done better and to actually code over researching algorithms
  * bad and ugly over copy paste
  * implement simple algorithms over use crates or snippets
  * ignore rules at will

## How to run

Until further notice, 

    cargo run --release

will run all puzzles done.
